# Mini Workshop on CV Tasks using Amazon SageMaker

Training Computer Vision Models Training and Deployment using Amazon SageMaker 

In this mini-workshop, we shall learn how to use SageMaker's built-in algorithms for image datasets on computer vision (CV) tasks. CV has taken the world by storm, and not a month goes by without
a new breakthrough in extracting patterns from images and videos. In these set of demos, we will learn about three built-in algorithms designed specifically for CV tasks.

We will cover the following:
- Discovering the CV built-in algorithms in Amazon SageMaker
- Preparing image datasets
- Using the CV built-in algorithms: 
  - Image classification, 
  - Object detection, and
  - Semantic segmentation.
